# AppStore

Orchesty offers a library of applications and connectors, which are ready to be used in your processes.  
We can freely extend this set and create custom collections of new elements.

## Appstore installation
AppStore is distributed as a public bundle, more precisely **Symfony bundle**. Installation is possible within every
service that implements **PHP-SDK**. Applications are ready to authorize in the interface of [Admin](../admin/admin.md)
after installation and their connectors are available in [Process editor](../admin/process-editor).

More information about [how to use connectors from Appstore collection](../get-started/Orchesty-Store.md).
