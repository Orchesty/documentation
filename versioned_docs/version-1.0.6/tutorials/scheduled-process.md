# Scheduled process

Scheduled process execution is very simple with Orchesty and provides the same options as scheduling with cron.

## Creating a scheduled process

To ensure that a process runs on a schedule, use **cron event** when building the process. We can try it on any process we have already built in the previous tutorials. In our process, we will use our first [custom node](../tutorials/custom-node.md) and create a process that will send data to the user task every minute. We will include the **cron** element at the beginning of the process.

Cron event is set using the **cron tab** format. Optionally, we can also specify the input data of the process. The settings are made in the editor in the right column of the node settings. We enter the expression `*/1 * * * * *` in the **Cron time** field.

## Starting

Now that we have saved and run the topology, we can see the time of the next process execution in the upper right corner. To abort the process, deactivate it with the **disable** button.

## Overview of planned tasks

An overview of all scheduled tasks across all running topologies can be found in the **Scheduled tasks** tab.
