# Getting started with Orchesty tutorials

In our tutorials, we'll walk you through the complete Orchesty experience, from the basic steps of getting started for the first time, creating a connector and a process, to advanced features such as handling rate limits or processing large batches.

You can download all the code we'll be creating throughout the tutorials with our sample project for a better understanding. The install process is the same as the Orchesty installation described in [Installation](../get-started/installation.md), we'll just use a different repository:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orchesty/Installer/main/InstallScript.sh)" -s tutorial
```
So if we have it installed, we can get to work...
