# Trash

The trash is a tool for persisting invalid or undelivered messages. Similar to user task, it allows you to preview and correct data. We can also see the message headers from which we can read the reason for discarding the message to the trash.

We can return messages from the trash to the process. The **Approve** button returns the message to the node from which it was discarded. The trash also allows bulk editing and user filtering of data.
